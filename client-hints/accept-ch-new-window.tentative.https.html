in this web page, and two in the other web pages.

// This test fetches resources/accept_ch.html. The response headers to
// that webpage contains only the Accept-CH header. These preferences should be
// stored so that the next request to the same origin is sent with the
// requested client hint headers.

// Next, to verify that the origin preferences were persisted by the user
// agent, this test fetches resources/expect_client_hints_headers.html in a new
// window. Fetching of resources/expect_client_hints_headers.html verifies that
// the user agent does send the client hints in the request headers.

// Test is marked as tentative until https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/issues/726
// is resolved.

// First, verify the initial state to make sure that the browser does not have
// client hints preferences cached from a previous run of the test.
